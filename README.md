# Compojure-Template

A Leiningen template for projects using [Compojure][1].

This tempate is a batteries included version of the official [compojure-template](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure-template).
The template sets up several useful wrappers, such as the ones for serving static resources and handling mime types.
It also provides a main for running standalone and a handler for WAR deployment which provides correct context resolution.

## Usage

Run the following command to create a new Compojure project:

    lein new compojure-app <your project name>

To create a standalone executable from your project inside the project directory:

```bash
lein ring uberjar
```

You can then run the resulting jar as you would with any other Java executable:

```bash
java -jar target/myapp-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
